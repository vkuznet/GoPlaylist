## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prepare your music files

DJServer plays files located in the `music/` directory. You can manually copy files there or use the provided helper tool `copytracks` to extract tracks from an `.m3u` playlist exported from macOS Music or similar apps:

```bash
# copytracks - copies and renames files using playlist order and metadata
copytracks -playlistFile myplaylist.m3u -dst music
```

The tool ensures:

* File names are formatted as `### - Artist - Title.ext` (e.g., `001 - Carlos Di Sarli - La Cumparsita.mp3`)
* All referenced files are copied into the `music/` folder

---

### 2. Build and run DJServer

```bash
# Build (optional if you have precompiled binary)
make build

# Run DJServer
./DJServer -musicDir=./music

# Open the interface
http://localhost:8080
```

* Default port is `8080`. Use `-port` flag to change.
* Use `-musicDir` to specify a different folder for your music files.
